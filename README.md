# KeyNews

## Listen to most relevant news multiple times a day using Text to speech engine:

-Repeated sessions allow user to have two types of repetition rules - interval (repeat every x) and scheduled.

-each Repeated session can have multiple repetition rules set, for example: a few scheduled rules to read a session at set times,
and an interval rule for frequent reading.

-each Repeated session lets user set it's own Reading feed, articles to read per session, delay between each article per session;

-other settings for Repeated sessions: to optionally include article's body (of RSS), to announce relevant age of article.


## Have multiple reading feeds, configured each of them for your convenience:

-configure each Reading feed to have any combination of your existing News sources.

-apply your filtration rules (whitelist/blacklist) by keywords or by AI-filtering, which will compare each news article against user's custom prompt.
You will need to obtain your own Gemini API key ( https://aistudio.google.com/apikey ) and paste it in settings.


## Set multiple smart filters (keywords, AI-filtering) for news:

-create multiple keyword filter rules of either types (whitelist/blacklist)

-optionally, import your own list of keywords from file

-apply a number of keyword rules to any reading feed

-create multiple AI-filtering rules of either types (whitelist/blacklist)

-apply up to one AI-filtering rule of both types to a feed (it only can have 1 whitelist and 1 blacklist of AI-filtering max)
